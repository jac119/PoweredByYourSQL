This app will be created out of my need for listable note items to be able to contain other listable note items as well as have the information 
sorted in multiple ways.

The driving force(and main testing example) is a need to keep a list of restaurants, and store: ratings, menu items, date visited(or each visit 
as its own item with such items) and at the users request present them in a list that is sorted in the way they choose, ie) Restaurants with a rating
above 8/10 with chicken alfredo, sorted by date visited (oldest first) 

As time goes on, more functionality will be added as other needs are seen.
